The Random Password Generator is a simple and efficient tool designed to generate secure and customizable passwords.
The script uses Python's string module to define character sets for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
These sets are combined based on user preferences to form the pool of characters from which the password is generated.
 # output
 The generated password is returned as a string, which can then be printed or stored.
